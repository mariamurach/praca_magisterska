Discarding all alignments below the unique anchor length of 10000 bp
Use --keep-small-uniques to keep all the fully unique alignments even below this length
Use --unique-length X to set the unique anchor length requirement. Default is 10000, such that each alignment must have at least 10000 bp from the query that are not included in any other alignments.
